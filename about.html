          <h2>My Bio</h2>
          <p>
            My name is <strong>Eniola Awoleke</strong> — a hardworking,
            passionate, and creative individual currently studying Computer
            Science in my final year. I’m also part of AltSchool Africa’s
            Frontend Engineering track, where I’m building strong technical
            skills to bring creative ideas to life on the web.

          <h2>My Goals In This Program</h2>
          <p>
            My goal in the HNG program is to challenge myself and grow beyond my
            current limits. I want to build real-world, user-centered
            applications, improve my teamwork and debugging skills, and prepare
            for full-time roles as a frontend developer.

          <h2>Areas Of Low Confidence</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes, I struggle with time management when balancing school
            work and tech projects. I also tend to overthink my designs or doubt
            my readiness to take on large projects — but I’m learning to take
            small, consistent steps each day.

          <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
          <p>
            Dear Future Eniola, remember how far you’ve come. Keep learning,
            stay consistent, and never compare your journey with others. You are
            building something great — be proud of it.

          <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve realized that growth happens when I’m uncomfortable — and every
            stage of learning (no matter how difficult) brings me closer to the
            confident engineer I’m becoming.
